//! [`ActionDiff`] event streams are minimalistic representations of the action state,
//! intended for serialization and networking.
//! While they are less convenient to work with than the complete [`ActionState`],
//! they are much smaller, and can be created from and reconstructed into [`ActionState`]
//!
//! Note that [`ActionState`] can also be serialized and sent directly.
//! This approach will be less bandwidth efficient, but involve less complexity and CPU work.
