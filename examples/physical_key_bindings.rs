//! For some controls, such as the classical WASD movement controls,
//! we don't care about the actual output of the keys, but rather where they are positioned.
//!
//! For example, on the French AZERTY keyboard layout, these keys are not in the standard triangle pattern,
//! so using them for player movement would feel very awkward.
//!
//! Instead, we can base our bindings on the physical position of the keys.
//! This functionality is provided by _scan codes_.
//!
//! In order to not deal with arbitrary numbers to define the key positions,
//! we can use [`QwertyScanCode`] to define the name of the keys on the US QWERTY layout.
//! The mapping to the other keyboard layouts is done automatically.
