## Testing

1. Use doc tests aggressively to show how APIs should be used.
You can use `#` to hide setup code from the doc tests, but use this sparingly.
2. Unit test belong near the code they are testing. Use `#[cfg(test)]` on the test module to ignore it during builds, and `#[test]` on the test functions to ensure they are run.
3. Integration tests should be stored in the top level `tests` folder, importing functions from `lib.rs`.

Use `cargo test` to run all tests.

## CI

The CI will:

1. Ensure the code is formatted with `cargo fmt`.
2. Ensure that the code compiles.
3. Ensure that (almost) all `clippy` lints pass.
4. Ensure all tests pass on Windows, MacOS and Ubuntu.

Check this locally with:

1. `cargo run -p ci`
2. `cargo test --workspace`

To manually rerun CI:

1. Navigate to the `Actions` tab.
2. Use the dropdown menu in the CI run of interest and select "View workflow file".
3. In the top-right corner, select "Rerun workflow".

## Documentation

Documentation is handled with standard Rust doc strings.
Use `cargo doc --open` to build and then open the docs locally.
