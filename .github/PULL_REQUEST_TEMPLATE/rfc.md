RFCs are used to collaboratively refine particularly complex designs in a scalable fashion before work begins.

For *Leafwing Studios,* the RFC process is pretty straightforward:

1. Copy the `docs/src/rfc/archived/000-rfc-template.md` file into a new file in the `active` subfolder.
2. Choose a descriptive feature name and the next available RFC number, and update the template and file name.
3. Reference any related issues / work in this PR's thread to ensure proper linking.
4. Refine the RFC until the team is ready to begin implementation.
5. To reduce overhead, follow-up work should be done as part of the same PR if possible.
6. Once the RFC is complete, move it from active to archived.
